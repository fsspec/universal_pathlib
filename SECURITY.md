# Security Policy - Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have discovered a security issue in universal-pathlib, do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it via the repositoryâ€™s **`Security`** tab using the **`Report a vulnerability`** button.
Include clear details and verify whether the vulnerability is in `universal-pathlib` or one of its dependencies.

Providing a minimal reproducible example will help resolve the issue more efficiently.
